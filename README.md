# Shoot em up!

A Work in progress Shmup made using

- Heaps.io
- GmFk (WIP library I want to reuse for future games)
- Ldtk & CastleDB
- Art resources crourtesy of KenneyNL

This game was mostly created while exploring Heaps.io and Ldtk.
I ended up moving up a lot of code I think will be useful into GMFK.

## Dependencies

GMFK is not published in haxelib yet, so you'll have to set the dev path to the downloaded gmfk.

1. Download [Gmfk](https://github.com/droidkid/gmfk)
2. Setup haxelib to point to Gmfk
`$ haxelib dev gmfk ../path/to/gmfk`
